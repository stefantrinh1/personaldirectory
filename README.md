# Personal Directory

> __**Run out of room on your favourites bar?**__  
> __**Is everything too nested?**__    
> __**Have too many links you use regularly?**__  

Why not use a Personal Directory with everything you need displayed on one Browser page.

A Personal Directory page that uses a grid system to display favourite links. It is currently tailored to a web developer user but can be arranged to make your own personal directory that suits your needs. it has single image grids and large grids for lists.
