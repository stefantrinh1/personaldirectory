# Personal Directory

Run out of room on your favourites bar?
Is everything too nested?
Have too many links you use regularly?

Why not use a Personal Directory with everything you need displayed on one Browser page.

A Personal Directory page that uses a grid system to display favourite links. It is currently tailored to a web developer user but can be arranged to make your own personal directory that suits your needs. it has single image grids and large image grids for lists.
